            Helped immensely with stress and anxiety control as well as helped
            me maintain my diet better through repeated hypnosis sessions. I
            always leave hypnosis sessions with Jeff feeling much less anxious
            and stressed. Repeated sessions have helped me lose weight with a
            combination of behavior modification and hypnosis to reinforce it.
            It has also helped with my confidence by helping me envision who
            exactly I want to be/strive to be. I’ve found this very helpful in
            my treatment and everyday life, I highly recommend this as part of
            your treatment and highly recommend Jeff.

            I contacted Jeff to address my general anxiety and irrational fear
            of something in particular and in just one month Jeff helped me to
            overcome my general anxiety and helped with my procrastination and
            issues surrounding perfectionism. We met once a week and each
            session he gave me a few small tips and tools that I was able to
            apply through the week. Meditation had not always been accessible to
            me because when I was having extreme anxiety I felt like a I
            couldn't catch my breath and doing mediation that focused on the
            breath usually made it worse. Jeff guided me through a few short
            meditations that did not focus on the breath and I now meditate
            every day which helps my anxiety immensely. We are still working on
            the irrational fear but I have no doubt that it won't be long before
            that is resolved fully as well. I highly recommend Jeff for helping
            with issues surrounding fear and anxiety.

            I consider Jeff to be not only a therapist, but a healer. It isn't
            only his knowledge and expertise that defines the way he works with
            people; it's also the power of his caring and his intent. Every
            hypnosis session I've had with him has left me with profound
            realizations about my life's journey. For me, those experiences have
            been like having the most meaningful of dreams while awake... As
            children, we have an innate connection to the wellspring of the
            imagination, but many of us tend to lose touch as we grow older. In
            helping me to experience again how strongly my imagination can
            influence the way I feel, Jeff reconnected me with the creative
            power of the imagination (teaching me how to use it as a tool for
            cultivating a positive mindset & for meditation/relaxation), and in
            that way, I feel so much more connected to myself, as well as my
            intuition...<br />I believe that a true healer shows a person that
            they have the power to heal themselves. Jeff has always encouraged
            me to seek the answers within, which has boosted my confidence in my
            ability to trust myself and has helped to liberate my
            self-expression. But whenever I'm over-complicating things, or
            feeling stuck or unable to figure things out independently, he is an
            honest, straightforward guide who brings me back down to earth by
            offering me alternate perspectives and the practical insights
            necessary to help me find my way again. I can talk to him about
            anything, but it's more than just a safe space to vent or to purge
            stagnant emotion; the conversations actually leave me with so much
            to think about in my own time. Having realized that I wasn't loving
            myself, nor living my life as the person I was ultimately born to
            be, I have been able to shed so many painful illusions that had been
            plaguing my mind for years following traumas that I had been unable
            to cope with or process on my own. As hard as I may have tried to go
            it alone, it was therapy which finally began to ease the struggle...
